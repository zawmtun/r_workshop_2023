# Preparation {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the workshop for an introduction to data analysis with R!

The focus of this workshop is primarily to familiarise the participants with R code and introduce some of the popular R packages for analysing data. We will cover the basics of R code, RStudio interface, importing CSV files, the structure of data frames, factors and dates, calculate summary statistics, and a brief introduction to plotting and regression analysis. We will go through these lessons in 10 hours spread over 5 days (2 hours per day).

However, in-depth discussion of the epidemiological or statistical concepts are not within the scope of this workshop; we would need more than 10 learning hours for that!

This workshop does not assume any prior knowledge of R or RStudio or any prior programming experience.

## Requirements

All participants are required to use their own laptops throughout the workshop. You can follow the lessons with both Windows and Mac laptops. You must be able to install R and RStudio on your laptop. Please do the installations before the workshop begins.

Please make sure your laptop is fully charged each day before the workshop. We may not be able to provide enough electricity sockets for every participants.

## Installations

We will need to install both R and RStudio for analysing data. R and RStudio are two separate pieces of software. Both are open source software - anyone can download them for free.

-   R is a programming language particularly designed for data exploration, visualisation, and statistical analysis.
-   RStudio is an integrated development environment that makes using R easier. RStudio is created by Posit, an open-source software company. We will use RStudio to interact with R in this workshop.

You will need R and RStudio installed on your computer before the workshop starts. Follow the instructions below based on your operating system.

You need to install R first and then install RStudio.

If you have installed an older version of R and RStudio or if you are not sure about the versions, please do a new installation.

### Steps for installing R and RStudio

-   Download R and RStudio installers from [Posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
-   Run the installer (`.exe` file for Windows and `.pkg` file for MacOS) for R
-   Run the installer for RStudio
-   Once installed, open RStudio to check that it works and no error messages

### Install necessary R packages

We will need `tidyverse`, `broom`, `gtsummary`, and `patchwork` packages to follow the lessons from this workshop. Once you open RStudio, you will see the R Console pane on the left-side of your screen.

Please copy and paste the following code to R Console, next to `>` prompt and press Enter. This will automatically install necessary packages to your computer.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "broom", "gtsummary", "patchwork"))
```

Alternatively, you can install the packages using RStudio's graphical user interface by going to `Tools > Install packages` and type the names of the packages separated by a comma.

R will try to download and install the packages on your computer. When the installation is complete, you can try to load the package by pasting the following code to the console.

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
library(gtsummary)
library(patchwork)
library(broom)
```

If you do not see an error like `there is no package called ...`, the package installation was successful.
