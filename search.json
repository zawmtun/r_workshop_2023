    "text": "Preparation\nWelcome to the workshop for an introduction to data analysis with R!\nThe focus of this workshop is primarily to familiarise the participants with R code and introduce some of the popular R packages for analysing data. We will cover the basics of R code, RStudio interface, importing CSV files, the structure of data frames, factors and dates, calculate summary statistics, and a brief introduction to plotting and regression analysis. We will go through these lessons in 10 hours spread over 5 days (2 hours per day).\nHowever, in-depth discussion of the epidemiological or statistical concepts are not within the scope of this workshop; we would need more than 10 learning hours for that!\nThis workshop does not assume any prior knowledge of R or RStudio or any prior programming experience."

    "text": "Installations\nWe will need to install both R and RStudio for analysing data. R and RStudio are two separate pieces of software. Both are open source software - anyone can download them for free.\n\nR is a programming language particularly designed for data exploration, visualisation, and statistical analysis.\nRStudio is an integrated development environment that makes using R easier. RStudio is created by Posit, an open-source software company. We will use RStudio to interact with R in this workshop.\n\nYou will need R and RStudio installed on your computer before the workshop starts. Follow the instructions below based on your operating system.\nYou need to install R first and then install RStudio.\nIf you have installed an older version of R and RStudio or if you are not sure about the versions, please do a new installation.\n\nSteps for installing R and RStudio\n\nDownload R and RStudio installers from Posit website.\nRun the installer (.exe file for Windows and .pkg file for MacOS) for R\nRun the installer for RStudio\nOnce installed, open RStudio to check that it works and no error messages\n\n\n\nInstall necessary R packages\nWe will need tidyverse, broom, gtsummary, and patchwork packages to follow the lessons from this workshop. Once you open RStudio, you will see the R Console pane on the left-side of your screen.\n\nPlease copy and paste the following code to R Console, next to > prompt and press Enter. This will automatically install necessary packages to your computer.\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"broom\", \"gtsummary\", \"patchwork\"))\n\nAlternatively, you can install the packages using RStudio’s graphical user interface by going to Tools > Install packages and type the names of the packages separated by a comma.\nR will try to download and install the packages on your computer. When the installation is complete, you can try to load the package by pasting the following code to the console.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gtsummary)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(broom)\n\nIf you do not see an error like there is no package called ..., the package installation was successful."

    "text": "We will manually download the example dataset from this link. If you are expecting problems with the network, it may be better to download the data before the workshop and store it on your computer.\nThe example dataset is a simplified subset of the Myanmar Demographic Health Survey (2014-2015). In this analysis, we are primarily interested in maternal tetanus vaccination. Thus, women who reported at least one birth in the last five years were included in the dataset.\nMaternal tetanus vaccination was defined as newborns protected against neonatal tetanus. According to the Myanmar National Guidelines for Antenatal Care, a newborn is protected against neonatal tetanus if the mother has received any of the following:\n1. Two injections of tetanus toxoid containing vaccine during the last pregnancy\n2. Two or more injections, the last one within three years of the last pregnancy\n3. Three or more injections, the last one within five years of the last pregnancy\n4. Four or more injections, the last one within 10 years of the last pregnancy\n5.
