    "text": "Installations\nWe will need to install both R and RStudio for analysing data. R and RStudio are two separate pieces of software. Both are open source software - anyone can download them for free.\n\nR is a programming language particularly designed for data exploration, visualisation, and statistical analysis.\nRStudio is an integrated development environment that makes using R easier. RStudio is created by Posit, an open-source software company. We will use RStudio to interact with R in this workshop.\n\nYou will need R and RStudio installed on your computer before the workshop starts. Follow the instructions below based on your operating system.\nYou need to install R first and then install RStudio.\n\nInstallation steps\n\nDownload R and RStudio installers from Posit website.\nRun the installer (.exe file for Windows and .pkg file for MacOS) for R\nRun the installer for RStudio\nOnce installed, open RStudio to check that it works and no error messages\n\n\n\nInstall necessary R packages\nWe will need tidyverse, gtsummary, patchwork packages to follow the lessons from this workshop. Once you open RStudio, you will see the R Console pane on the left-side of your screen. Please copy the following code to R Console and press Enter. This will automatically install necessary packages to your computer.\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"gtsummary\", \"patchwork\"))\n\nAlternatively, you can install the packages using RStudio’s graphical user interface by going to Tools > Install packages and type the names of the packages separated by a comma.\nR will try to download and install the packages on your computer. When the installation is complete, you can try to load the package by pasting the following code to the console.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gtsummary)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nIf you do not see an error like there is no package called ..., the package installation was successful."
