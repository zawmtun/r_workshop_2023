    "text": "Preparation\nWelcome to the workshop for an introduction to data analysis with R!\nThe focus of this workshop is primarily on familiarising the participants with R code and introducing some of the popular R packages for analysing data. We will cover the basics of R code, RStudio interface, importing CSV files, the structure of data frames, factors and dates, calculate summary statistics, and a brief introduction to plotting and regression analysis. We will go through these lessons in 12.5 hours spread over 5 days (2.5 hours per day).\nHowever, in-depth discussion of the epidemiological or statistical concepts are not within the scope of this workshop; we would need more than 12 learning hours for that!\nThis workshop does not assume any prior knowledge of R or RStudio or any prior programming experience.",

    "text": "Installations\nYou will need to install a few things in your computer to get ready for the workshop.\n\nInstall R and RStudio\nboth R and RStudio for analysing data. R and RStudio are two separate pieces of software. Both are open-source: anyone can download them for free.\n\nR is a programming language particularly designed for data exploration, visualisation, and statistical analysis.\nRStudio is an integrated development environment that makes using R easier. RStudio is created by Posit, an open-source software company. We will use RStudio to interact with R in this workshop.\n\nPlease follow the instructions below based on your operating system.\nYou need to install R first and then install RStudio.\nIf you have installed an older version of R and RStudio or if you are not sure about the versions, please do a new installation.\nSteps for installing\n\nDownload R and RStudio installers from Posit website.\nRun the installer (.exe file for Windows and .pkg file for MacOS) for R\nRun the installer for RStudio\nOnce installed, open RStudio to check that it works and no error messages\n\n\n\nInstall necessary R packages\nWe will need tidyverse, broom, gtsummary, patchwork, collapse, flextable, and tsibble packages to follow the lessons. Once you open RStudio, you will see the R Console pane on the left-side of your screen.\n\nPlease copy and paste the following code to R Console, next to &gt; prompt and press Enter. This will automatically install necessary packages to your computer.\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"broom\", \"gtsummary\", \"patchwork\", \"collapse\", \"flextable\", \"tsibble\"))\n\nAlternatively, you can install the packages using RStudio’s graphical user interface by going to Tools &gt; Install packages and type the names of the packages separated by a comma.\nR will try to download and install the packages on your computer. When the installation is complete, you can try to load the package by pasting the following code to the console.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gtsummary)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(collapse)\nlibrary(flextable)\nlibrary(tsibble)\n\nIf you do not see an error like there is no package called ..., the package installation was successful.\n\n\nInstall Quarto\nIn this workshop, we will create reports programmatically and a simple dashboard using Quarto, an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. The dashboard is a new feature added to Quarto 1.4 only in Jan 2024. So, please download and install the latest version of Quarto.\n\n\nRegister for a RPubs account\nAfter creating a dashboard, we will need to deploy it on a web site to give access to its users. As an example, here is the dashboard we will build during the workshop. There are many options to do it. Some of easier than the others. The best place to get started, in my opinion, is RPubs as it is integrated seamlessly with RStudio. To follow along the exercises, please register for a RPubs account. You will asked to log in to your account while publishing your dashboard on RPubs.",
